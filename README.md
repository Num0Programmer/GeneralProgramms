# GeneralProgramms
A repository that hold any base scripts. These are scripts that are bare bones that would be added to create more complex programs.

From here, the scripts are put into respective subcategories based on their intended uses. For example, the first two scripts to be made are a client.py and a server.py to get a base setup and understanding for server stuff. These two file will go into a subcategory called "Networking."
